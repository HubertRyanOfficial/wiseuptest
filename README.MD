# Wise Up Test

In this project you will have a list of users, you can connect using auth with standard email and password, simulating a user login to be able to show a list of users using the Mock API together with Firebase Auth. All states being monitored and changed using Redux, Redux Saga and Redux Persisted.
By Hubert Ryan.

## About

With React Native, using the Mock API to make the call with Axios, receiving all the users ids and others data, also using for firebase Auth only with a registered email and password to simulate the login.

About the registered email is `"wiseuptest_hubertryan@gmail.com"` with the password: `123456` (to tests). As in this project I used Firebase Auth, the project depends on a google .JSON config, but I will leave this config to be able to help you while you test and you do not need to create a project in Google firebase, but if you want to change the google services file, it is located in `android / app /`.

Remembering that I tried to get as close to the layout in relation to the designer. I am very grateful for the opportunity to show this project and participate in this challenge and I hope it will be accepted.

## Dependencies

As stated in the PDF shown for the challenges, practically all dependencies were used to be able to complete the challenges, adding more in order for the routes to work correctly. Below are all the dependencies that were used for this project to be completed.

- [x] Typescript
- [x] Redux
- [x] Redux Saga
- [x] Redux Persist
- [x] React Navigation
- [x] Axios
- [x] Styled Components
- [x] React Native Firebase
- [x] Firbease Auth
- [x] Async Storage

> Important: All dependencies for TypeScript typing were installed as development dependencies and not for production. This is because in the end, all these files will be compiled again for javascript. React Navigation was optionally added for navigation between the Home Screen and List Users Screen.

# Getting Started

## Install

First, you need to clone this project to an ideal location on your computer. You can clone either using the github command line or by downloading directly from the browser or the WINRAR file, after that, extract it.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/HubertRyanOfficial/wiseuptest.git
```

or

```sh
Download direct to you computer with WINRAR or with GitHub Desktop.
```

Second, install all necessary project dependencies locally so that the project can run smoothly. Of course, go to the project folder before that!

```sh
$ yarn install
```

or

```sh
$ npm install
```

## Run the project

If you didn't change google-services.JSON at the beginning for the functioning of Firebase Auth, we can move on to be able to run the app on your emular or physical phone.

> Important: This project is adept at the android system, not for IOS.

Now just run for android.

```sh
$ yarn android
```

or

```sh
$ npm run android
```

Now we can use and develop our project, are we going to test together with me? **Let's Go!**

# Thank You
