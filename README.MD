# Wise Up Test

In this project you will have a list of users, you can connect using auth with standard email and password, simulating a user login to be able to show a list of users using the Mock API together with Firebase Auth. All states being monitored and changed using Redux, Redux Saga and Redux Persisted.
By Hubert Ryan.

## About

With React Native, using the Mock API to make the call with Axios, receiving all the users ids and others data, also using for firebase Auth only with a registered email and password to simulate the login.

About the registered email is `"wiseuptest_hubertryan@gmail.com"` with the password: `123456` (to tests). As in this project I used Firebase Auth, the project depends on a google .JSON config, but I will leave this config to be able to help you while you test and you do not need to create a project in Google firebase, but if you want to change the google services file, it is located in `android / app /`.

Remembering that I tried to get as close to the layout in relation to the designer. I am very grateful for the opportunity to show this project and participate in this challenge and I hope it will be accepted.

## Dependencies

As stated in the PDF shown for the challenges, practically all dependencies were used to be able to complete the challenges, adding more in order for the routes to work correctly. Below are all the dependencies that were used for this project to be completed.

- [x] Typescript
- [x] Redux
- [x] Redux Saga
- [x] Redux Persist
- [x] React Navigation
- [x] Axios
- [x] Styled Components
- [x] React Native Firebase

> Important: All dependencies for TypeScript typing were installed as development dependencies and not for production. This is because in the end, all these files will be compiled again for javascript.
