# Wise Up Test

In this project you will have a list of users, you can connect using auth with standard email and password, simulating a user login to be able to show a list of users using the Mock API together with Firebase Auth. All states being monitored and changed using Redux, Redux Saga and Redux Persisted.
By Hubert Ryan.

### About

With React Native, Using the Mock API to make the call with Axios, receiving all the users ids and others data, also using for firebase Auth only with a registered email and password to simulate the login.

About the registered email is `"wiseuptest_hubertryan@gmail.com"` with the password: `123456` (to tests). As in this project I used Firebase Auth, the project depends on a google .JSON config, but I will leave this config to be able to help you while you test and you do not need to create a project in Google firebase, but if you want to change the google services file, it is located in `android / app /`.
